# Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem in Python and C++ using the ROOT framework
In this document we are going to show how to develop an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for solving the TSP using the data analysis software package by CERN, ROOT. The interface is in python to keep things simple but the logic is in C++.
